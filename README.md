The code begins by loading payment and invoice data, cleaning and preprocessing it, then moves on to exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of payment timeliness, the amount of payments, and the relationship between payment timeliness and the payment amount. Next, it trains a RandomForestClassifier to predict payment timeliness based on selected features. 
The trained model is evaluated, and feature importances are analyzed. Additionally, the code performs customer segmentation using K-means clustering based on payment patterns. Finally, it predicts late payments for open invoices and analyzes the distribution and correlation of predicted late payments.
